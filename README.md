# KeepUpGame


This is a simple game I built to help myself get started and familiar with creating a GUI in Java.  

The user controls a "trampoline" with the objective of keeping all the balls up. The game starts off with one ball coming down, and every 6 seconds a new one is added from a random spot going in a random direction, making the game increasingly difficult as it goes on. If a ball gets past the trampoline the game is over. 


To play it, run the frame.java file. This will initiate the main method and open up the game window.
